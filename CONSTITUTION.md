# Bugema Open Source Community (BOSC) Constitution

## 1. Introduction

The Bugema Open Source Community (BOSC) is a student- and faculty-driven initiative at Bugema University that fosters innovation, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing through open-source projects. To ensure effective leadership and long-term sustainability, BOSC adopts the Benevolent Dictator leadership model, where the founding leader/coordinator acts as the Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) while working closely with contributors and project maintainers.

## 2. Leadership Model – Benevolent Dictatorship

### 2.1 The Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)

**Current BDFL: Muwanga Kosea**

- Acts as the visionary and steward of BOSC.
- Has final decision-making authority on technical, organizational, and governance matters.
- Ensures that decisions align with BOSC's mission: openness, collaboration, community-driven innovation.
- Serves as mentor and guide for students, project maintainers, and contributors.

### 2.2 Benevolence in Leadership

- Decisions are made transparently and in consultation with the community.
- Feedback channels (forums, mailing lists, GitHub discussions) are actively used before finalizing major decisions.
- Leadership prioritizes the growth and learning of contributors over personal interests.

### 2.3 Steering Committee Support

- The BDFL is supported by a Steering Committee (faculty advisors, senior contributors, project maintainers).
- The committee advises on strategy and helps in execution of community programs.
- In case the BDFL is unavailable or steps down, the committee oversees a leadership transition.

## 3. Membership

- **Eligibility**: Open to Bugema University students, faculty, alumni, and external collaborators with interest in open source.
- **Joining**: Members register through the official BOSC portal, GitHub, or community sign-up form.
- **Rights of Members**:
  - Access to BOSC projects, events, and training.
  - Freedom to contribute code, documentation, or ideas.
  - Right to propose new initiatives.
- **Responsibilities of Members**:
  - Respect community guidelines and values.
  - Contribute constructively and ethically.
  - Acknowledge others' work properly (no plagiarism).
  - Follow open-source licenses of BOSC projects.

## 4. Code of Conduct

- Treat all members with respect, fairness, and inclusivity.
- Zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or exclusion.
- Disagreements should be handled professionally and respectfully.
- Transparency in contributions—no hidden agendas or sabotage.
- Violations may result in warnings, suspension, or removal from BOSC.

## 5. Supporting Structures

### 5.1 Project Maintainers

- Each BOSC project (e.g., GreenCode, LifeLine-ICT, OpenCare-Africa) has a maintainer or small team.
- Maintainers review contributions, manage repositories, and ensure quality standards.
- They report to the BDFL but are empowered to make project-level decisions.

### 5.2 Steering Committee

- A BOSC Steering Committee is formed from senior contributors, faculty advisors, and long-term volunteers.
- Provides advice to the BDFL on strategy and governance.
- Handles administrative tasks such as partnerships, outreach, and community events.

### 5.3 Contributors

- Any student, faculty member, or external collaborator can become a contributor.
- Contributors submit code, documentation, research, or ideas.
- Contributions are reviewed by project maintainers before integration.

## 6. Contribution Rules

- **Contribution Workflow**:
  1. Fork project repository.
  2. Make changes (code, documentation, design).
  3. Submit Pull Request (PR).
  4. Project Maintainers review and approve.
  5. Final integration under BDFL/maintainer authority.
- **Quality Standards**:
  - Code must be well-documented.
  - Contributions should align with project goals.
  - Testing is required before submission.
- **Acknowledgment**: Significant contributors are credited in project documentation.

## 7. Decision-Making Process

- **Minor Decisions**: Maintainers handle day-to-day technical issues.
- **Major Decisions**: Discussed openly (forums, GitHub issues, meetings).
- **Final Authority**: BDFL resolves disputes and makes the final decision.

## 8. Project Operations

- BOSC hosts multiple projects (e.g., GreenCode, LifeLine-ICT, OpenCare-Africa).
- Each project has:
  - A Maintainer (lead for technical direction).
  - A Contributor Team (students, faculty, or collaborators).
- Projects follow open-source licensing (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache).

## 9. Community Activities

- **Weekly/Monthly Meetups**: To share progress, brainstorm, and onboard new members.
- **Hackathons/Code Sprints**: For rapid development and innovation.
- **Workshops & Trainings**: To build members' skills (Git, coding, project management, AI, etc.).
- **Research & Publications**: Members collaborate on academic outputs and open-source research papers.

## 10. Communication Channels

- **GitHub** → for code collaboration.
- **Mailing List/Google Groups** → official announcements.
- **Slack/Discord/Telegram** → daily discussions and quick updates.
- **University Notice Boards & Website** → offline awareness.

## 11. Recognition & Rewards

- **Badges & Certificates**: For active contributors and project leaders.
- **Showcasing Work**: Projects presented at BOSC events, conferences, and publications.
- **Leadership Opportunities**: Active contributors can become maintainers or join the Steering Committee.

## 12. Conflict Resolution

- Disagreements are first addressed within project teams.
- If unresolved, the issue escalates to the Steering Committee.
- The BDFL has the final say to avoid deadlocks and ensure progress.

## 13. Disciplinary Measures

## 14. Succession and Sustainability

- The BDFL mentors future leaders to ensure continuity.
- If the BDFL steps down, the Steering Committee leads the transition process to appoint a new leader.
- Documentation and mentoring ensure projects survive beyond student graduation.
- Partnerships with industry, other universities, and open-source foundations sustain BOSC in the long term.

## 15. Benefits of the Model

- **Clarity & direction**: A visionary leader ensures BOSC stays mission-driven.
- **Stability**: Quick decisions avoid stagnation and maintain momentum.
- **Learning culture**: Mentorship helps students gain skills in leadership, coding, and project management.
- **Scalability**: As BOSC grows, governance can evolve to a more distributed model without losing identity.
